Today I generated a fine-tuning training set from the training file. OpenAPI recommends a certain format so I just
iterated through the training file and create a new one with the format that is recommended. I initiated a fine-tuning
job, which runs async in the open ai cloud. Once it is done I should be able to test with it on the test set.

The fine tuning job failed after hours of waiting because it would "exceed billing hard limit." My limit is set to $10,
so I'm going to reduce the training file size and try again. Unfortunately the error message didn't tell me the cost
estimate, so I'm having to guess at how much training data to reduce. I cut the training data in half and started a
new job.
