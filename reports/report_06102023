Today I read the gpt-4 technical paper. Interestingly they don't reveal much detail in this paper, and they cite safety and competition as the reasons. What I did learn is gpt-4 doesn't really need re-enforcement learning from human traininers to perform better. That process is mostly to fine-tune the model so that it resonponds appropriately to sensitive topics. The paper reinforces the fact that gpt-4 is extremely good at few and zero shot learning, which will be important for my project.
