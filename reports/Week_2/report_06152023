Today I read feedback from Prof Jamal, questioning whether larger language models would actually translate to better
ship trajectory prediction. This is a valid concern. I found two papers which I added to my project that both claim
to obtain similar few-shot performance as GPT3, at a fraction of the model and training data size. After reading these
papers my impression is that yes it is possible to get similar results with smaller models, but it also requires more
manual, logic-like training of the model. In other words, it almost feels like a hybrid of a LLM and an expert system
shown patterns that it should pick up on. This is a fine approach, but expert systems have always performed better than
machine learning methods. The larger model would at least reduce the amount of time/effort that I will need to put forth
to get results.
