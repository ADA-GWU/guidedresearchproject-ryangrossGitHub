Today I tried to adjust the prompt engineering to have the system only guess lat and lon, not speed or direction.
It performed horribly, as in over 20mile error after the first hour. So I think the input being an array of size 4
and an output being size 2 really confused GPT. When I have it guess all 4 values for the output it does much better,
just over 1mile error for the first two hours.
