After being recently asked about open source alternatives to GPT, I wanted to see if there are any models comparable to GPT.
I found several models in this article: https://beebom.com/best-large-language-models-llms/
It seems like ClaudeV1 is the leading open source model. It turns out this model is funded by Google and former OpenAI employees
are part of the team. This model has beat Google's own PALM LLM on certain benchmarks. If I have extra time at the end of the
project I would like to compare my GPT3.5 results to ClaudeV1 results.
