Today I generated a fine-tuning training set from the training file. OpenAPI recommends a certain format so I just
iterated through the training file and create a new one with the format that is recommended. I initiated a fine-tuning
job, which runs async in the open ai cloud. Once it is done I should be able to test with it on the test set.
