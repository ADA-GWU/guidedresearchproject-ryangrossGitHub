Today I spent a little more time looking at the test and train pickel files in my data folder. The values are all
normalized, meaning latitude and longitude values are showing as float values less than 1. It took me a little while
to understand why the data looked this way. My next steps will be to write a function to scale the normalized values
back to normal in order to better check how the gpt-3.5-turbo system performs. Scaling back to normal values will also
allow me to visualize the points on a map.
