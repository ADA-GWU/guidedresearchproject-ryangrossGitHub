Today I looked at the https://github.com/CIA-Oceanix/TrAISformer repo to better understand it. This repo modifies the
gpt-2 open source code, hard-coding specific parts of the code-base to work specifically for vessel trajectory
prediction. I was able to run the code with the debugger in pycharm to better understand what the data files look like.
I've added the test and train data files to my repo, as I want to do an apples to apples comparison of gpt-4 with the
results from the TrAISformer paper.
